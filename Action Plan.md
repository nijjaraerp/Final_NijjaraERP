# Improved Development Plan for Nijjara ERP System

## General Improvements and Best Practices
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement proper password policies, rate limiting for login attempts, and secure session management.
- **Testing Strategy**: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests throughout development, not just at the end.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct peer reviews for all code changes.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for APIs, database schemas, and user guides.
- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control with meaningful commit messages and branching strategy.
- **Performance**: Optimize database queries, implement caching where appropriate, and monitor performance metrics.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI components are accessible (WCAG compliance).
- **Internationalization**: Support Arabic RTL layout and localization.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular data backups and disaster recovery plans.
- **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for production issues.

## Phase 1: The Core Backend & Seeding (Your Current Step) - Estimated: 2-3 Days

Goal: Build the server-side "brain," the "nervous system" (logging), and seed the database with its first user (your Admin account). Ensure robust error handling and security from the start.

Files to Create:

- Code.js: (Main file for doGet(), include()).
- Logging.js: (CRITICAL) (Contains logError_, logInfo_ with structured logging).
- Auth_Password.js: (Contains hashPassword_, checkPassword_ with secure salt management).
- Seed_Data.js: (CRITICAL) (Contains seedAdminUser_, etc. with validation).
- Seed_Functions.js: (PROVIDED BELOW) (Contains runApplyAllFormulas()).

To-Do List:

1. Create Logging.js: This is your first priority. Create the logError_ and logInfo_ functions that write to the SYS_Error_Log sheet with timestamps, user context, and error levels. All other server-side code depends on this file. Include log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR).

2. Create Auth_Password.js: Create the hashPassword_ function using Utilities.computeHmacSha256Signature with a unique salt per user (store salt separately). Implement checkPassword_ with constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. Add password strength validation.

3. Create Seed_Data.js: This file will have a master function runSeedAllData(). It must run in this specific order to respect data dependencies. Add rollback functionality in case of failures.

   - seedRoles(): Adds the "Admin" role to SYS_Roles (will generate a role_id). Validate uniqueness.
   - seedEmployee(): Adds "Mohamed Sherif Amin Elkhoraiby" to HRM_Employees (will generate an employee_id). Include data validation.
   - seedAdminUser(): This function will:
     - Get the role_id for "Admin".
     - Get the employee_id for "Mohamed...".
     - Call hashPassword_("210388") to get the secure hash.
     - Write the new record to SYS_Users with validation:
       - full_name: "Mohamed Sherif Amin Elkhoraiby"
       - user_id: "mkhoraiby" (unique)
       - password_hash: (the hashed password)
       - email: "m.elkhoraiby@gmail.com" (validate format)
       - role_id: (from step 1)
       - employee_id: (from step 2)
       - is_active: TRUE
       - created_at: timestamp
       - salt: (store the salt used)

4. Create Seed_Functions.js: Copy the file I have provided below into your project. Review and optimize formulas for performance.

5. Run the Seeding: Push all new files (npm run deploy). Then, from the Apps Script editor, run these functions in order:
   - runSeedAllData() (from Seed_Data.js)
   - runApplyAllFormulas() (from Seed_Functions.js)

6. Verify: Check the SYS_Users sheet. You should see your "mkhoraiby" user, and all the Arabic columns should be populated with formulas pointing to the English columns. Run basic validation tests.

7. Unit Tests: Write and run unit tests for logging, password hashing, and seeding functions.

## Phase 2: The Core Frontend & UI Shell (2 Days)
Goal: Create the "skeleton" of the Single-Page Application (SPA) and, most importantly, the client-side error handling. Focus on responsive design and user experience.

Files to Create (in HTML): We use .html files for client-side code and load them with a helper function.

- App.html: The main, single HTML file. Contains the div structure (<div id="login-view">, <div id="workspace-view">) with semantic HTML.
- CSS.html: All CSS styles (including Dark Mode, Cairo font, and responsive design).
- JS_Global.html: (CRITICAL FILE) This will contain our client-side error handling and utilities.
- JS_Server.html: A helper file to make google.script.run calls easier to manage with proper error handling.

To-Do List:

1. Create App.html: Add the basic HTML structure with ARIA labels, a "loading..." spinner with accessibility, and the main divs. Include meta tags for mobile responsiveness.

2. Create CSS.html: Add the CSS to import the Cairo font, set up the basic dark UI with CSS variables for theming. Implement responsive breakpoints and ensure RTL support for Arabic.

3. Create JS_Global.html: This is the key. Include utility functions.

   - Create a global log(message, level): Wrapper for console.log() that can be toggled and includes timestamps.
   - Create handleClientError(errorObject, functionName): This function will:
     - console.error('[CLIENT ERROR]', functionName, errorObject);
     - Show a user-friendly "toast" notification with retry options.
     - Call google.script.run.withFailureHandler(onServerError).logError_('CLIENT_SIDE: ' + functionName, errorObject, ...);
   - Set the Global Catcher: window.onerror = function(message, source, lineno, colno, error) { handleClientError(error, 'GLOBAL_WINDOW_ONERROR'); };
   - Add unhandled promise rejection handler.

4. Create JS_Server.html: Create a "promisified" wrapper for google.script.run with timeout handling, retry logic, and loading indicators.

5. Accessibility Audit: Run basic accessibility checks on the UI shell.

## Phase 3: Module 1 - Authentication & SYS (4-5 Days)

Goal: Build the first end-to-end user story: Login. Implement secure authentication flow.

To-Do List:

1. Build the server-side Auth.js file with authenticateUser(username, password). This function will:
   - Input validation and sanitization.
   - Find the user row in SYS_Users.
   - Call checkPassword_(plainPassword, storedHash) (from Auth_Password.js).
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
   - If valid, generate a secure session token, call getBootstrapData(), and return it to the client.
   - If invalid, logError_ with appropriate level and return error message (avoid revealing if user exists).
   - Include account lockout after failed attempts.

2. Build the client-side JS_Login.html to create the login form with:
   - Input validation
   - Remember me functionality
   - Forgot password link (for future implementation)
   - Loading states and error messages

3. Implement session management on client and server side.

4. Write integration tests for the login flow.

5. Security Review: Conduct a security audit of the authentication system.

## Phase 4: Full Module Rollout (2-3 Weeks)
Goal: Rapidly build the HRM, PRJ, and FIN modules using the dynamic system.

To-Do List:

1. This is the easy part. You don't need to write new UI code. The JS_ViewTab.html and JS_FormModal.html renderers you built in Phase 3 are dynamic.

2. Your only job is to populate SET_Tab_Register and SET_Dynamic_Forms with the metadata for the new modules. Validate metadata for consistency.

3. The system will build the tables and forms automatically.

4. You will only need to write new server-side files for any special logic (e.g., Payroll.js to run calculations with proper validation, Projects.js to update a budget with transaction logging).

5. For each module:
   - Define data models and relationships
   - Implement business logic with error handling
   - Add validation rules
   - Write unit and integration tests
   - Document APIs

6. Performance Optimization: Optimize queries and implement pagination for large datasets.

7. Data Migration: Plan for data migration if needed for existing data.

## Phase 5: Testing, Deployment & Go-Live (2 Weeks)
Goal: Move from development to a stable, live-production system with thorough testing and monitoring.

To-Do List:

1. Unit Testing: Ensure all functions have unit tests with good coverage.

2. Integration Testing: Test module interactions and data flows.

3. Alpha Testing: You use the system for 5-7 days for all your work, logging issues.

4. Beta Testing: Give access to 3-5 trusted "test users." Collect feedback systematically.

5. User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Formal testing with defined scenarios.

6. Performance Testing: Load testing and performance benchmarking.

7. Security Testing: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.

8. Error Log Review: Continuously monitor and fix bugs throughout development, not just at the end.

9. Code Freeze: Announce "no new features" 3 days before go-live.

10. Final Code Review: Review all code for security, performance, and best practices.

11. Backup: Create full system backup before deployment.

12. Create a Version: In the Apps Script Editor, go to Deploy > New Deployment. Select "Web App" and create a versioned deployment with description.

13. Go-Live: Use the production URL from this new deployment. Monitor closely for the first 48 hours.

14. Post-Go-Live: Monitor performance, gather user feedback, and plan for iterative improvements.
